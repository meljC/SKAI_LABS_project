## Task 1: Display Polygon on a Map

### Description

The goal of this task is to create a web application that displays a polygon, defined in a provided JSON file, on a map using the OpenLayers library. The application fetches polygon coordinates (JSON file) from a Flask server and displays the polygon on a map, ensuring the map centers on the polygon and adjusts its zoom to make the entire polygon visible.

### Technologies Used

- Python with Flask for the backend server
- JavaScript with OpenLayers for frontend map display

### How to Run

1. **Set up the Flask server:**
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
   - Install Flask using `pip install Flask`.
   - Run the server using `python app.py`.

2. **Accessing the Application:**
   - Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to view the application.
